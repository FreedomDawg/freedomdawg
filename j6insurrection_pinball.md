## ABOUT

I first made this table in 2022 as a personal project and have brought it to various public events as a free to play, interactive exhibit on my portable tabletop pinball cabinet. I've had many requests to make it generally available so i worked on it some more and packaged it for [download from my public drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-4TTwENX0uT4GfNnp1fkNy2gPNb6QrIf&usp=drive_fs)

If you don't like the idea or theme of this table, please just move on. No haters please. It's for fun and education.
Enjoy!
