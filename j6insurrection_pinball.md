# ABOUT

I first made this table in 2022 as a personal project and have brought it to various public events as a free to play, interactive exhibit on my portable tabletop pinball cabinet. I've had many requests to make it generally available so i worked on it some more and packaged it for [download from my public drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-4TTwENX0uT4GfNnp1fkNy2gPNb6QrIf&usp=drive_fs)

If you don't like the idea or theme of this table, please just move on. No haters please. It's for fun and education.
Enjoy!

Table is based on Dirty Harry pinball table by Williams (1995) and mod of the open source VPX table by authors in the Visual Pinball community. For education and entertainment only.
